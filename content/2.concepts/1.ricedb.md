Rice's storage layer is a high-performance database designed for Multi-Agent AI Systems.

| Challenge | Solution |
| :-------- | :------- |
| Knowledge has relationships | Integrated semantic linking |
| Multi-tenant environments | Bitmap-based ACL for zero-latency permission checks |
| High-frequency updates | LSM-tree storage with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) |
| Real-time notifications | Pub/Sub with semantic subscriptions |

---

## Features

- **High Performance**: Supports both HTTP and gRPC transports
- **Multi-User ACL**: Bitmap-based access control with zero-latency permission checks
- **Real-time Pub/Sub**: Server-side streaming with semantic subscriptions (gRPC)
