---

Slate is the state and runtime context management layer that sits between your AI agents and RiceDB. It provides a cognitive memory architecture inspired by human cognition.

---

## Memory Architecture

Slate provides four memory types:

| Memory Type | Purpose |
| :---------- | :------ |
| **Working Memory** | Direct bridge between storage and runtime. Pre-fetches context and relevant data. |
| **Episodic Memory** | Captures and tracks agent data: reasoning, inputs, outcomes, and actions. |
| **Procedural Memory** | Stores executable skills, code, and sub-agents. |
| **Semantic Memory** | Stores invariant facts and knowledge for agentic use. |

---

## Working Memory

Working Memory is the direct bridge between storage and your agent's runtime. It pre-fetches context and has associative data points loaded and available for use.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Decay**: Items decay over time if not accessed, simulating natural forgetting
- **Attention**: Items are returned sorted by relevance (Attention Score)
- **High-Velocity**: Optimized for rapid read/write cycles

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `focus(content)` | Push information into the agent's attention stream |
| `drift()` | Retrieve current context sorted by relevance |

```python
# Store context
client.focus("User is planning a trip to Japan")
client.focus("Budget is around $3000")

# Retrieve context (sorted by relevance)
context = client.drift()
```

---

## Episodic Memory

Episodic Memory captures and tracks agent data including reasoning, inputs, outcomes, and actions. Every action an agent takes can be committed as a trace.

**Trace Structure:**

| Component | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| **Input** | What triggered the action |
| **Action** | What the agent decided to do |
| **Outcome** | The result of the action |
| **Reasoning** | Why the agent made that decision |

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Semantic Retrieval**: Uses vector search to find similar past experiences
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Past traces enable in-context learning
- **Persistent**: Stored long-term for continuous improvement

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `commit(input, outcome, action, reasoning)` | Record an experience as a trace |
| `reminisce(query)` | Recall past experiences similar to the query |

```python
# Record an interaction
client.commit(
    input="What should I pack for Japan?",
    outcome="Suggested layers, umbrella, walking shoes",
    action="travel_advice",
    reasoning="Spring weather is variable"
)

# Recall similar past interactions
past = client.reminisce("packing for Asia trip")
```

---

## Procedural Memory

Procedural Memory stores executable skills, code, and sub-agents. It runs compiled WebAssembly modules server-side with deterministic, sandboxed execution.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Compiled Skills**: Pre-built WebAssembly modules for common operations
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same output
- **Sandboxed**: Runs securely without exposing your infrastructure

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `trigger(skill_name)` | Execute a server-side WASM skill |

```python
# Execute a skill
result = client.trigger("calculate_tax")
```

**Use Cases:**

- Financial calculations (no hallucination)
- Data validation and transformation
- Complex algorithms requiring exact execution

---

## Semantic Memory

Semantic Memory stores invariant facts and knowledge for agentic use. Unlike Episodic Memory which stores experiences, Semantic Memory holds general knowledge that doesn't change frequently.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Factual Storage**: Stores facts, definitions, and reference data
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Maintains relationships between concepts
- **Shared Context**: Knowledge available across all agent sessions

**Use Cases:**

- Product catalogs and specifications
- Company policies and procedures
- Domain-specific knowledge bases
- Reference documentation

---

## The Agent Loop

Every cognitive agent follows this pattern:

1. **Perceive**: Receive user input
2. **Recall**: `reminisce(input)` - Find similar past experiences
3. **Orient**: `drift()` - Get current context
4. **Decide**: Generate a plan using your LLM
5. **Act**: Execute tool or generate response
6. **Learn**: `commit(input, action, outcome)` - Save the result
7. **Update**: `focus(new_state)` - Update working memory

```python
async def agent_loop(user_input):
    # Recall past experiences
    past = client.reminisce(user_input)
    
    # Get current context
    context = client.drift()
    
    # Generate response with LLM
    response = await llm.generate(
        input=user_input,
        context=context,
        examples=past
    )
    
    # Learn from this interaction
    client.commit(
        input=user_input,
        outcome=response,
        action="respond",
        reasoning="Generated based on context and past examples"
    )
    
    # Update context
    client.focus(f"User asked: {user_input}")
    client.focus(f"Agent responded: {response}")
    
    return response
```

## Connection

```python
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(
    address="localhost:50051",
    token="your-auth-token"
)

# Test connection
client.focus("Hello, Slate!")
items = client.drift()
print(f"Connected! Items: {len(items.items)}")
```

```typescript
import { CortexClient } from "./rice_slate/clients/node/dist";

const client = new CortexClient("localhost:50051", "your-token");

await client.focus("Hello, Slate!");
const items = await client.drift();
console.log(`Connected! Items: ${items.length}`);
```
