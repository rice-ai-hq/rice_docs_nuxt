  description: Four-component memory architecture for building intelligent AI agents.
---

Slate is the state and runtime context management layer that sits between your AI agents and storage. It provides a cognitive memory architecture inspired by human cognition.

---

## Memory Architecture

Slate provides four memory types:

| Memory Type | Internal Module | Purpose |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :------ |
| **Working Memory** | Flux | Context buffer with time-decay attention |
| **Episodic Memory** | Echoes | Long-term interaction history with vector search |
| **Semantic Memory** | Nexus | Knowledge graph and fact storage |
| **Procedural Memory** | Reflex | WASM runtime for executing agent skills |

---

## Installation

### Node.js / TypeScript

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/slate.git#subdirectory=clients/node
```

### Python

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/slate.git#subdirectory=clients/python
```

---

## Connecting to Slate

Both clients use `CortexClient` to communicate with Slate. You need the server address and an optional auth token.

::code-group
```python [Python]
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(
    address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
    token="your-auth-token",
    run_id="my-session"  # Optional, defaults to "default"
)
```

```typescript [Node.js]
import { CortexClient } from "slate-client";

const client = new CortexClient(
  "grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
  "your-auth-token",
  "my-session"  // Optional, defaults to "default"
);
```
::

## Working Memory (Flux)

Working Memory manages the agent's immediate context with dynamic decay and attention.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Decay**: Items decay over time if not accessed, simulating natural forgetting
- **Attention**: Items are returned sorted by relevance (Attention Score)
- **High-Velocity**: Optimized for rapid read/write cycles

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `focus(content)` | Push information into the agent's attention stream |
| `drift()` | Retrieve current context sorted by relevance |

::code-group
```python [Python]
# Add to working memory
response = client.focus("User is planning a trip to Japan")
print(f"Stored with ID: {response.id}")

client.focus("Budget is around $3000")

# Retrieve context (sorted by relevance)
response = client.drift()
for item in response.items:
    print(f"[{item.relevance:.2f}] {item.content}")
```

```typescript [Node.js]
await client.focus("User is planning a trip to Japan");
await client.focus("Budget is around $3000");

const items = await client.drift();
items.forEach((item) => {
  console.log(`[${item.relevance}] ${item.content}`);
});
```
::

## Episodic Memory (Echoes)

Episodic Memory stores the history of interactions as traces. Every action an agent takes can be committed for future learning.

**Trace Structure:**

| Component | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| **Input** | What triggered the action |
| **Outcome** | The result of the action |
| **Action** | What the agent decided to do |
| **Reasoning** | Why the agent made that decision |

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `commit(input, outcome, ...)` | Record an experience as a trace |
| `reminisce(query)` | Recall past experiences similar to the query |

::code-group
```python [Python]
# Record an interaction
client.commit(
    "What should I pack for Japan?",  # input
    "Suggested layers, umbrella, walking shoes",  # outcome
    action="travel_advice",
    reasoning="Spring weather is variable"
)

# Recall similar past interactions (limit defaults to 5)
response = client.reminisce("packing for Asia trip", limit=3)
for trace in response.traces:
    print(f"Past: {trace.input} -> {trace.outcome}")
```

```typescript [Node.js]
// Record an interaction
await client.commit(
  "What should I pack for Japan?",
  "Suggested layers, umbrella, walking shoes",
  {
    action: "travel_advice",
    reasoning: "Spring weather is variable"
  }
);

// Recall similar past interactions (limit defaults to 5)
const traces = await client.reminisce("packing for Asia trip", 3);
traces.forEach((trace) => {
  console.log(`Past: ${trace.input} -> ${trace.outcome}`);
});
```
::

---

## Procedural Memory (Reflex)

Procedural Memory executes compiled WebAssembly skills server-side with deterministic, sandboxed execution.

**API:**

| Method | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `trigger(skill_name)` | Execute a server-side WASM skill |

::code-group
```python [Python]
result = client.trigger("calculate_tax")
```

```typescript [Node.js]
const result = await client.trigger("calculate_tax");
```
::

---

## Semantic Memory (Nexus)

Semantic Memory stores invariant facts and knowledge. It maintains a knowledge graph with relationships between concepts.

**Use Cases:**

- Product catalogs and specifications
- Company policies and procedures
- Domain-specific knowledge bases
- Reference documentation

---

## Run Separation

Slate supports multi-tenancy through the `run_id` mechanism. Each run is isolated and all operations are scoped to the current run.

### Creating Isolated Sessions

```python
# Each agent has its own memory space
agent1 = CortexClient(address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", run_id="agent-1")
agent2 = CortexClient(address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", run_id="agent-2")

# Data from agent1 won't appear in agent2's memory
agent1.focus("Secret info for agent 1")
agent2.drift()  # Returns empty
```

### Shared Memory for Teams

```python
# Multiple agents sharing the same memory
researcher = CortexClient(address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", run_id="research-team")
writer = CortexClient(address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", run_id="research-team")

# Both can read and write to the same memory space
researcher.focus("Found relevant paper on topic X")
writer.drift()  # Sees the researcher's context
```

### Cleaning Up

::code-group
```python [Python]
# Delete all data for the current run
client.delete_run()
```

```typescript [Node.js]
await client.deleteRun();
```
::

---

## The Agent Loop

Every cognitive agent follows this pattern:

1. **Perceive**: Receive user input
2. **Recall**: `reminisce(input)` - Find similar past experiences
3. **Orient**: `drift()` - Get current context
4. **Decide**: Generate a plan using your LLM
5. **Act**: Execute tool or generate response
6. **Learn**: `commit(input, outcome, ...)` - Save the result
7. **Update**: `focus(new_state)` - Update working memory

```python
def agent_loop(user_input):
    # Recall past experiences
    past = client.reminisce(user_input, limit=3).traces
    
    # Get current context
    context = client.drift().items
    
    # Generate response with LLM
    response = llm.generate(
        input=user_input,
        context=context,
        examples=past
    )
    
    # Learn from this interaction
    client.commit(
        user_input,  # input
        response,  # outcome
        action="respond",
        reasoning="Generated based on context and past examples"
    )
    
    # Update context
    client.focus(f"User asked: {user_input}")
    client.focus(f"Agent responded: {response}")
    
    return response
```

## Authentication

Slate supports token-based authentication. Get your auth token from the [Slate Console](https://console.tryrice.com).

::code-group
```python [Python]
client = CortexClient(address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", token="your-token")
```

```typescript [Node.js]
const client = new CortexClient("grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80", "your-token");
```
::

---

## Vector Store Backends

Slate supports multiple vector database backends for Episodic and Semantic memory:

| Provider | Configuration |
| :------- | :------------ |
| **Mock (In-Memory)** | Default, no config needed |
| **Qdrant** | Set `QDRANT_URL` |
| **Pinecone** | Set `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_HOST` |
| **ChromaDB** | Set `CHROMA_URL` |
| **RiceDB** | Set `RICEDB_URL` |
