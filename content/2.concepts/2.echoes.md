**"The Autobiography"**

Echoes stores the history of interactions. Every action an agent takes can be "committed" as a trace, enabling the agent to learn from past experiences.

---

## Key Concepts

### Traces

A trace is a record of a complete interaction, consisting of four components:

| Component | Description | Example |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------ |
| **Input** | What triggered the action | "Create a button component" |
| **Action** | What the agent decided to do | "WriteCode" |
| **Outcome** | The result of the action | "Created Button.tsx with styling" |
| **Reasoning** | Why the agent made that decision | "User asked for a button, chose Tailwind for consistency" |

### Semantic Retrieval

Echoes uses vector search to find past experiences similar to the current situation. This enables:

- **Few-shot learning**: Inject relevant past examples into prompts
- **Consistency**: Make similar decisions in similar situations
- **Improvement**: Learn from past mistakes

---

## API Reference

### `commit(input, outcome, action, reasoning)`

Record an experience as a trace.

**Node.js**

```typescript
await client.commit(
  "Create a button component",     // Input
  "Created Button.tsx",            // Outcome
  {
    action: "WriteCode",
    reasoning: "User asked for a button"
  }
);
```

**Python**

```python
client.commit(
    input="Create a button component",
    outcome="Created Button.tsx",
    action="WriteCode",
    reasoning="User asked for a button"
)
```

### `reminisce(query)`

Recall past experiences similar to the query.

**Node.js**

```typescript
const traces = await client.reminisce("How do I center a div?");
traces.forEach((trace) => {
  console.log(`Past Action: ${trace.action}`);
  console.log(`Past Outcome: ${trace.outcome}`);
  console.log(`Reasoning: ${trace.reasoning}`);
});
```

**Python**

```python
traces = client.reminisce("How do I center a div?").traces
for trace in traces:
    print(f"Past Action: {trace.action}")
    print(f"Past Outcome: {trace.outcome}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {trace.reasoning}")
```

---

## Use Cases

### Few-Shot Learning

Before taking an action, check how similar situations were handled.

```typescript
async function handleRequest(userInput: string) {
  // Find similar past experiences
  const pastExperiences = await client.reminisce(userInput);
  
  // Build few-shot prompt
  const examples = pastExperiences.map(t => 
    `Input: ${t.input}\nAction: ${t.action}\nOutcome: ${t.outcome}`
  ).join("\n\n");
  
  const prompt = `Learn from these examples:\n${examples}\n\nNow handle:\n${userInput}`;
  // ... call LLM
}
```

### Learning from Mistakes

Record failures with reasoning to avoid repeating them.

```python
# After a failed attempt
client.commit(
    input="Deploy to production",
    outcome="Failed: Missing environment variables",
    action="Deploy",
    reasoning="Rushed deployment without checking .env.example"
)

# Later, when deploying again
traces = client.reminisce("Deploy to production")
# Agent sees the past failure and checks env vars first
```

### User Preference Recall

Remember user preferences across sessions.

```typescript
await client.commit(
  "What framework should I use?",
  "Recommended Next.js based on their React experience",
  {
    action: "Recommendation",
    reasoning: "User mentioned they know React, prefer TypeScript"
  }
);

// Weeks later...
const prefs = await client.reminisce("framework recommendation");
// Returns the past preference context
```

## Best Practices

::callout{icon="i-lucide-check-circle" color="primary"}
**Commit after every action**: Build a rich experience history. Even "boring" traces help establish patterns.
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-tag" color="amber"}
**Use consistent action names**: Create a vocabulary of action types (e.g., "WriteCode", "SearchDocs", "AskClarification") for better retrieval.
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-pencil" color="blue"}
**Be specific in reasoning**: Explain *why* decisions were made. This context is invaluable for future similar situations.
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-circle" color="red"}
**Record failures too**: Failed attempts are valuable learning opportunities. Include what went wrong and why.
