# Research Assistant

Build an assistant that:
- Remembers your research interests
- Learns what sources you find useful
- Improves recommendations over time

---

## The Core Idea

A stateless research tool treats every query as new. With Rice, your assistant builds a profile of your interests and remembers what worked.

| Memory Type | What It Does |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| **Working Memory** | Current research session notes |
| **Episodic Memory** | Past research queries and useful findings |
| **Semantic Memory** | Facts and knowledge you've collected |

---

## Setup

```bash
# If you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/rice_slate.git
cd rice_slate/clients/python
pip install -e .
cd ../../..

mkdir research-assistant && cd research-assistant
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
SLATE_ADDRESS=localhost:50051
SLATE_TOKEN=your-token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

---

## The Assistant

```python
# assistant.py
import os
import json
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
from slate_client import CortexClient

load_dotenv()

slate = CortexClient(
    address=os.getenv("SLATE_ADDRESS"),
    token=os.getenv("SLATE_TOKEN")
)
openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))


def research(query: str) -> str:
    # 1. Find past related research
    past_research = slate.reminisce(query)
    
    # 2. Get current session notes
    session = slate.drift()
    
    # 3. Build context-aware prompt
    prompt = build_prompt(query, past_research, session)
    
    # 4. Generate synthesis
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    synthesis = response.choices[0].message.content
    
    # 5. Save to current session
    slate.focus(json.dumps({
        "type": "research_note",
        "query": query,
        "synthesis": synthesis[:200]  # Store summary
    }))
    
    # 6. Learn from this research
    slate.commit(
        input=query,
        outcome=synthesis[:500],
        action="research",
        reasoning="User researched this topic"
    )
    
    return synthesis


def build_prompt(query: str, past_research: list, session: list) -> str:
    prompt = "You are a research assistant.\n\n"
    
    # Add past related research
    if past_research:
        prompt += "RELATED PAST RESEARCH:\n"
        for item in past_research[:3]:
            prompt += f"- Query: {item.input}\n  Finding: {item.outcome[:200]}...\n\n"
    
    # Add current session context
    notes = [s for s in session if s.get("type") == "research_note"]
    if notes:
        prompt += "CURRENT SESSION NOTES:\n"
        for note in notes[-5:]:
            prompt += f"- {note.get('query')}: {note.get('synthesis', '')[:100]}...\n"
        prompt += "\n"
    
    prompt += f"NEW QUERY: {query}\n\n"
    prompt += "Provide a helpful synthesis. Reference past research if relevant."
    
    return prompt


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # First query
    print("Query: What is hyperdimensional computing?")
    result = research("What is hyperdimensional computing?")
    print(f"Response: {result[:300]}...\n")
    
    # Follow-up (assistant now has context)
    print("Query: How does it compare to neural networks?")
    result = research("How does it compare to neural networks?")
    print(f"Response: {result[:300]}...")
```

---

## What's Happening

**Finding Past Research**

```python
past_research = slate.reminisce(query)
```

When you ask about "hyperdimensional computing", Episodic Memory searches for related past queries. If you researched vector databases last week, that context appears.

**Session Continuity**

```python
session = slate.drift()
```

Working Memory keeps your current session notes. Follow-up questions have context from earlier in the session.

**Learning**

```python
slate.commit(input=query, outcome=synthesis, action="research", reasoning="...")
```

Every query is saved. Your assistant learns your interests over time.

---

## Building User Profiles

The assistant naturally builds a profile of your interests:

```python
def get_user_interests() -> list:
    # Search for all past research
    all_research = slate.reminisce("research topics interests")
    
    # Extract common themes
    topics = [r.input for r in all_research]
    return topics
```

After a few sessions, `reminisce()` returns your most common research areas first.

---

## Adding Knowledge Storage

Store facts using Semantic Memory:

```python
def save_fact(topic: str, fact: str):
    """Save a permanent fact for future reference"""
    # This would use Semantic Memory API
    slate.focus(json.dumps({
        "type": "fact",
        "topic": topic,
        "content": fact,
        "permanent": True
    }))


def research_with_facts(query: str) -> str:
    # Get stored facts on this topic
    context = slate.drift()
    facts = [c for c in context if c.get("type") == "fact"]
    
    # Include facts in prompt
    # ...
```

---

## Multi-Session Example

**Session 1**
```python
research("What is quantum computing?")
research("How do qubits work?")
# Both saved to Episodic Memory
```

**Session 2 (next day)**
```python
research("Quantum error correction")
# Past research on quantum topics is retrieved
# Assistant connects to previous learning
```

**Session 3 (next week)**
```python
research("Compare quantum and classical computing")
# Full context from all previous sessions
```

The assistant remembers everything across sessions.

---

## Summary

The research loop:

1. **Reminisce**: Find related past research
2. **Drift**: Get current session notes
3. **Generate**: LLM synthesizes with full context
4. **Focus**: Save to current session
5. **Commit**: Learn for future sessions

Your assistant gets smarter with every query.
