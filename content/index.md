**The Unified Database for Autonomous AI Agents**

Rice is the first database purpose-built for the next generation of AI agents. It unifies **Hyper Vector Search**, **Neural Associations**, and **Agent Memory** into a single, high-performance engine.

#title
[Dual-Memory Architecture]{.text-primary}

#description
Seamlessly integrate **Working Memory** (scratchpad) for active tasks with **Long-Term Memory** (Hyper Vectors & Associations) for deep knowledge. Agents can "think" fast in scratchpad and "remember" deep context from long-term storage.

#title
[Structural Reasoning]{.text-primary}

#description
Go beyond simple similarity. Navigate semantic associations natively to give your agents true context understanding. Rice finds not just what is _similar_, but what is _connected_.

#title
[High Performance]{.text-primary}

#description
Built on Rust with a Zero-Copy architecture. Low-latency retrieval optimized for real-time agent interactions, even under heavy load.

[Secure by Design]{.text-primary}

#description
Granular Access Control Lists (ACLs) ensure data isolation in multi-tenant environments. Perfect for building SaaS platforms where data privacy is paramount.
