This guide will walk you through setting up Slate and connecting your first agent.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1.  Navigate to the **[Slate Console](https://console.tryrice.com)**.
2.  Create an account using your email or social login.

## Step 2: Create Your Instance

Once logged in to the dashboard:

1.  Click the **"Create New Instance"** button.
2.  Choose a name for your instance (e.g., `my-agent-memory`).
3.  Select your preferred region.
4.  Click **"Launch"**.

Your instance will be ready in a few seconds.

## Step 3: Get Credentials

After your instance is created, you will see a connection card.

1.  Locate the **Connect** section on your instance dashboard.
2.  You will see the following details:
    - **Address**: e.g., `grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80`
    - **Auth Token**: _[Hidden - click to reveal]_

**Important**: Keep your auth token secure. Do not commit it to public repositories.

## Step 4: Install the Client

Slate provides SDKs for Node.js/TypeScript and Python.

### Node.js / TypeScript

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/slate.git#subdirectory=clients/node
```

### Python

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/slate.git#subdirectory=clients/python
```

## Step 5: Connect and Verify

### Node.js

```typescript
import { CortexClient } from "slate-client";

const client = new CortexClient(
  "grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
  "your-secret-token",
  "my-session"  // Optional run_id for session isolation
);

// Test connection with a simple focus operation
await client.focus("Hello, Slate!");
const items = await client.drift();
console.log("Connected! Items in Working Memory:", items.length);
```

### Python

```python
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(
    address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
    token="your-secret-token",
    run_id="my-session"  # Optional run_id for session isolation
)

# Test connection with a simple focus operation
client.focus("Hello, Slate!")
items = client.drift()
print(f"Connected! Items in Working Memory: {len(items.items)}")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you are connected, you are ready to build!

- **[Learn about Concepts](/concepts)**: Understand Working, Episodic, Procedural, and Semantic memory systems.
- **[Build Your First Agent](#your-first-agent)**: Follow the example below.
- **[Explore Tutorials](/tutorials)**: See more complete examples.

## Your First Agent

Let's build a simple note-taking assistant that remembers what you tell it and learns from interactions. This example shows all four memory types in action.

### The Goal

Build an agent that can:
1. Remember notes you give it (Working Memory)
2. Learn from past interactions (Episodic Memory)
3. Store reference facts (Semantic Memory)

### Complete Example

::code-group
```typescript [Node.js]
import { CortexClient } from "slate-client";

const client = new CortexClient(
  "grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
  "your-token",
  "travel-agent"  // run_id for session isolation
);

// 1. WORKING MEMORY: Store current session context
await client.focus("User is planning a trip to Japan");
await client.focus("Budget is around $3000");
await client.focus("Interested in temples and food");

// Retrieve current context (sorted by relevance)
const context = await client.drift();
console.log("Current context:", context);

// 2. EPISODIC MEMORY: Learn from interactions
// Record a successful interaction
await client.commit(
  "What should I pack for Japan in spring?",  // Input
  "Suggested layers, umbrella, comfortable walking shoes",  // Outcome
  {
    action: "travel_advice",
    reasoning: "Spring weather is variable, lots of walking expected"
  }
);

// Later, recall similar past interactions
const pastAdvice = await client.reminisce("packing for Asia trip", 3);
console.log("Similar past advice:", pastAdvice);

// 3. Use past experience to improve responses
// The agent now knows what worked before
```

```python [Python]
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(
    address="grpc.your-instance-id.slate.tryrice.com:80",
    token="your-token",
    run_id="travel-agent"  # run_id for session isolation
)

# 1. WORKING MEMORY: Store current session context
client.focus("User is planning a trip to Japan")
client.focus("Budget is around $3000")
client.focus("Interested in temples and food")

# Retrieve current context (sorted by relevance)
context = client.drift()
print("Current context:", context.items)

# 2. EPISODIC MEMORY: Learn from interactions
# Record a successful interaction
client.commit(
    "What should I pack for Japan in spring?",  # input
    "Suggested layers, umbrella, comfortable walking shoes",  # outcome
    action="travel_advice",
    reasoning="Spring weather is variable, lots of walking expected"
)

# Later, recall similar past interactions
past_advice = client.reminisce("packing for Asia trip", limit=3)
print("Similar past advice:", past_advice.traces)

# 3. Use past experience to improve responses
# The agent now knows what worked before
```
::

### What Just Happened?

1. **Working Memory** held the current conversation context. When you called `drift()`, it returned items sorted by relevance.

2. **Episodic Memory** recorded a complete interaction trace. When you called `reminisce()`, it found similar past experiences using semantic search.

3. Your agent can now use past experiences to make better decisions.

### The Agent Loop

Every cognitive agent follows this pattern:

```
User Input
    ↓
Recall past experiences (reminisce)
    ↓
Get current context (drift)
    ↓
Make decision (your LLM)
    ↓
Take action
    ↓
Learn from result (commit)
    ↓
Update context (focus)
```

That's it. This simple loop is the foundation of every learning agent you'll build with Rice.
