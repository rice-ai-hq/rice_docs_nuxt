This guide will walk you through setting up Slate and connecting your first agent.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1.  Navigate to the **[Slate Console](https://app.tryrice.com)**.
2.  Create an account using your email or social login.

## Step 2: Create Your Instance

Once logged in to the dashboard:

1.  Click the **"Create New Instance"** button.
2.  Choose a name for your instance (e.g., `my-agent-memory`).
3.  Select your preferred region.
4.  Click **"Launch"**.

Your instance will be ready in a few seconds.

## Step 3: Get Credentials

After your instance is created, you will see a connection card.

1.  Locate the **Connect** section on your instance dashboard.
2.  You will see the following details:
    - **Address**: e.g., `xyz-123.slate.cloud:50051`
    - **Auth Token**: _[Hidden - click to reveal]_

**Important**: Keep your auth token secure. Do not commit it to public repositories.
::

## Step 4: Install the Client

Slate provides SDKs for Node.js/TypeScript and Python. Since the clients are not yet published to npm/PyPI, install directly from the GitHub repository.

### Node.js / TypeScript

```bash
# Clone the repository and install the client
git clone https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/rice_slate.git
cd rice_slate/clients/node
npm install
npm run build
```

### Python

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/rice_slate.git#subdirectory=clients/python
```

## Step 5: Connect and Verify

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="blue"}
**Note**: Adjust your import path based on where you cloned the repository. The examples below show local paths.
::

### Node.js

```typescript
// Adjust path to your local clone
import { CortexClient } from "./rice_slate/clients/node/dist";

const client = new CortexClient("localhost:50051", "your-secret-token");

// Test connection with a simple focus operation
await client.focus("Hello, Slate!");
const items = await client.drift();
console.log("Connected! Items in Flux:", items.length);
```

### Python

```python
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(address="localhost:50051", token="your-secret-token")

# Test connection with a simple focus operation
client.focus("Hello, Slate!")
items = client.drift()
print(f"Connected! Items in Flux: {len(items.items)}")
```
