This guide will walk you through setting up your serverless Rice backend and connecting your first agent.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1.  Navigate to the **[Rice Console](https://app.tryrice.com)**.
2.  Create an account using your email or social login.

## Step 2: Create Your Backend

Once logged in to the dashboard:

1.  Click the **"Create New Instance"** button.
2.  Choose a name for your backend (e.g., `my-agent-backend`).
3.  Select your preferred region.
4.  Click **"Launch"**.

Your instance will be ready in a few seconds.

## Step 3: Get Credentials

After your instance is created, you will see a connection card.

1.  Locate the **Connect** section on your instance dashboard.
2.  You will see the following details:
    - **Host**: e.g., `xyz-123.ricedb.cloud`
    - **Port**: `3000` (HTTP) or `50051` (gRPC)
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: _[Hidden - click to reveal]_

**Important**: Keep these credentials secure. Do not commit them to public repositories.

## Step 4: Install the Client

Rice provides a Python SDK for easy interaction. Since the project is in beta, install directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rice-ai-hq/ricedb-python
```

## Step 5: Connect and Verify

Create a new Python file `test_connect.py` and run the following code to verify your connection:

```python
from ricedb import RiceDBClient

# Replace with your actual credentials
HOST = "xyz-123.ricedb.cloud"
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "your_password_here"

# Connect
client = RiceDBClient(HOST)
client.connect()

# Authenticate
token = client.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
print(f"Successfully connected! Token: {token[:10]}...")

# Run a health check
print(f"Health status: {client.health()}")

client.disconnect()
```

Run the script:

```bash
python test_connect.py
```
