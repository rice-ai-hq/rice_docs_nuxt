This guide will walk you through setting up Slate and connecting your first agent.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1.  Navigate to the **[Slate Console](https://app.tryrice.com)**.
2.  Create an account using your email or social login.

## Step 2: Create Your Instance

Once logged in to the dashboard:

1.  Click the **"Create New Instance"** button.
2.  Choose a name for your instance (e.g., `my-agent-memory`).
3.  Select your preferred region.
4.  Click **"Launch"**.

Your instance will be ready in a few seconds.

## Step 3: Get Credentials

After your instance is created, you will see a connection card.

1.  Locate the **Connect** section on your instance dashboard.
2.  You will see the following details:
    - **Address**: e.g., `xyz-123.slate.cloud:50051`
    - **Auth Token**: _[Hidden - click to reveal]_

**Important**: Keep your auth token secure. Do not commit it to public repositories.

## Step 4: Install the Client

Slate provides SDKs for Node.js/TypeScript and Python.

### Node.js / TypeScript

```bash
npm install slate-client
```

### Python

```bash
pip install slate-client
```

## Step 5: Connect and Verify

### Node.js

```typescript
import { CortexClient } from "slate-client";

const client = new CortexClient("localhost:50051", "your-secret-token");

// Test connection with a simple focus operation
await client.focus("Hello, Slate!");
const items = await client.drift();
console.log("Connected! Items in Flux:", items.length);
```

### Python

```python
from slate_client import CortexClient

client = CortexClient(address="localhost:50051", token="your-secret-token")

# Test connection with a simple focus operation
client.focus("Hello, Slate!")
items = client.drift()
print(f"Connected! Items in Flux: {len(items.items)}")
```
