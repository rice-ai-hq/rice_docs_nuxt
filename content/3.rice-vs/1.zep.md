  description: Compare Rice with Zep for AI agent memory.
---

Zep provides long-term memory for AI using temporal knowledge graphs.

## Comparison

| Feature | Rice | Zep |
| :------ | :--- | :-- |
| **Philosophy** | Cognitive architecture mimicking human brain regions | Knowledge graph with structured data retrieval |
| **Working Memory** | Dynamic decay and attention scoring | Session buffer with summarization/windowing |
| **Procedural Memory** | Server-side WASM execution | None (relies on client-side tools) |
| **Data Structure** | HDC with graph equivalents | Temporal knowledge graph with nodes and edges |
| **Retrieval** | Separate APIs for past (reminisce) vs current (drift) | Hybrid semantic + graph + keyword search |

## Key Differences

### Memory Model

Rice uses a four-component cognitive architecture (Working, Episodic, Procedural, Semantic). Zep uses a temporal knowledge graph that explicitly models nodes and edges with bi-temporal tracking.

### Working Memory

Rice implements dynamic decay and attention scoring. Items naturally fade if not accessed, and `drift()` returns items sorted by relevance. Zep uses session buffers with summarization and windowing.

### Execution

Rice includes Procedural Memory for server-side WASM skill execution. Zep relies on client-side tool execution via agent frameworks like LangChain.

### Retrieval

Rice separates "remembering the past" (`reminisce`) from "orienting current context" (`drift`). Zep combines semantic vector search with graph traversal and keyword search.
