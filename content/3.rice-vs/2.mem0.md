## Comparison

| Feature | Rice | Mem0 |
| :------ | :--- | :--- |
| **Memory Model** | Four-component (Working, Episodic, Procedural, Semantic) | User/session scoped facts |
| **Learning** | Explicit trace commits (Input, Action, Outcome, Reasoning) | Implicit extraction from chat logs via LLM |
| **Execution** | Integrated procedural memory | External only |

## Key Differences

### Memory Model

Rice provides distinct memory systems for different purposes: Working (attention), Episodic (traces), Procedural (skills), and Semantic (facts). Mem0 focuses on user facts stored in vector/graph stores.

### Learning Mechanism

Rice uses explicit trace commits where agents record Input, Action, Outcome, and Reasoning. Mem0 automatically extracts facts from chat logs using an LLM pipeline.

### Execution

Rice includes integrated Procedural Memory for running compiled skills. Mem0 is strictly a storage/retrieval layer with no execution capabilities.

### Best For

Rice is built for agentic systems that need to learn behaviors (how to solve problems). Mem0 excels at user personalization (remembering preferences and facts).
