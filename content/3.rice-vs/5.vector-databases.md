## Comparison

| Feature | Rice | Vector Databases |
| :------ | :--- | :--------------- |
| **Abstraction** | Cognitive memory types with built-in APIs | Raw vectors requiring custom logic |
| **Context** | Decay, attention, and relevance scoring | k-NN similarity search |
| **Execution** | Integrated procedural skills | None |
| **Learning** | Trace-based episodic memory | Manual embedding management |

## Key Differences

### Abstraction Level

Rice provides cognitive memory types (Working, Episodic, Procedural, Semantic) with purpose-built APIs. Vector databases provide raw vector storage, leaving you to build all the memory logic yourself.

### Context Management

Rice includes decay, attention scoring, and relevance-based retrieval. Vector databases offer k-NN similarity search but no context management algorithms.

### Execution

Rice includes Procedural Memory for running compiled skills server-side. Vector databases are purely storage with no execution capabilities.

### Learning

Rice's Episodic Memory stores complete interaction traces (Input, Action, Outcome, Reasoning) for learning from experience. Vector databases store raw embeddings, requiring you to manage the structure manually.

### Best For

Rice is for building agents where you want memory management handled for you. Vector databases are for building custom RAG pipelines where you need full control over every aspect.
